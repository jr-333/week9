# week 9


## Background:
It was interesting to be able to set-up the honeypot and view all of the attacks that the sensor was receiving. It was a hassle to start the process due to account set-ups with google cloud. It was frustrating that the instructions provided did not fully work. There was some troubleshooting that was needed in order to get past milestone 2 of setting up the admin vm. Once that was resolved it was smooth sailing.

## Which Honeypot(s) you deployed: 
Dionaea with HTTP

## Any issues you encountered:

## A summary of the data collected:
