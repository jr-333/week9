It was interesting to be able to set-up the honeypot and view all of the attacks that the sensor was receiving. It was a hassle to start the process due to account set-ups with google cloud. It was frustrating that the instructions provided did not fully work. There was some troubleshooting that was needed in order to get past milestone 2 of setting up the admin vm. Once that was resolved it was smooth sailing.

## Which Honeypot(s) you deployed: 
Dionaea with HTTP

Ran into an issue were the script aborted because one of the repo's no longer existed. I had to browse the web for a fix as I did not know what script contained the line. Luckily I was able to find a fix.
